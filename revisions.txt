REVISIONS

v1.2
- Adjusted isMacInCorrectFormat() function in mac_format_module.py so it returns False if the MAC address is not supported, instead of raising an exception
- Added more comments throughout the code to make it more readable
- Moved some import statements around so they are not called unless needed
